# Foundation Dashboard

In this dashboard, you can find the status of all the projects that are part of the foundation from a high-level perspective. Every project listed includes additional reports with its own dashboard, tasks, and alerts.

## Overview

This dashboard is based on [OpenJS Security Compliance Standard v1.0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GwIsAudAn89xv9DAbr1HUaY4KEVBsYfg--_1cW0uIB0/edit?gid=0#gid=0), which defines a total of 74 checkpoints divided into 10 categories (user authentication, user account permissions, service authentication, github workflow permissions, vulnerability management, coordinated vulnerability disclosure, code quality, code review, source control, dependency inventory).

In this report, you can find **4 (5.41%) implemented checkpoints**. We are continuously working on adding more checkpoints and projects ([complete list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GwIsAudAn89xv9DAbr1HUaY4KEVBsYfg--_1cW0uIB0/edit?gid=0#gid=0)).
